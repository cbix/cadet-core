   * @brief Sets the section time vector
   * @details The integration time is partitioned into sections. All parameters
   * and equations are assumed continuous inside one section. Thus, sections
   *          provide means to implement discontinuous behavior (e.g., pulse
   * injection profiles, switching of valves). After initialization, the
   * simulator notifies all entities such as models or data sources of its
   * section times.
   *
   *          The vector of section times consists of strictly increasing time
   * points
   *          @f[ t_0 < t_1 < t_2 < \dots t_N @f]
   *          which mark the beginning and end of a section. The @f$ i@f$-th
   * section is given by
   *          @f[ \left[ t_i, t_{i+1} \right]. @f]
   *          If a transition from one section to the next is continuous, the @p
   * secContinuity flag for that transition is @c true. In this case, the time
   * integrator will not stop at the transition time point and reinitialize
   * consistently (which will be done for discontinuous transitions).
   *
   * @param [in] secTimes Vector with section time points (length is @p
   * nSections + 1)
   * @param [in] secContinuity Vector of flags that indicate a continuous (@c
   * true) or discontinuous (@c false) transition from the current section to
   * the next one (length is @p nSections - 1). For instance, the first element
   * indicates whether the transition from section @c 0 to @c 1 is continuous.
   * @param [in] nSections Number of sections
